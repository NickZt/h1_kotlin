###  MVI: Rendering Logic of State in Android: TDD Story

Welcome to the coding story about covering UI state testing logic for UI code written in kotlin using the MVI approach.

This approach is similar to the approach described in the Flutter world as BLOC or Cubit, in general computer science is known as FSM.

First let's take a look on view states structure to understand what is this UI logic about.

 The [States](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt) are registered in the MainFragmentUiStatesModel class. It is declared as a sealed class. This is because each of the sealed class implementations is itself a full-fledged class. This means that each of them can have its own sets of properties independently of each other.



Just launched and started initializing everything - [Initial](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt:6)
Maybe we'll write something, maybe we'll show a flying sausage monster (infinite ProgressBar)

We start reading from the source (DataSource) the loader is displayed -- [LoadCounterPercentDataState](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt:7) 

If somethig went wrong the  error is displayed -- [LoadErrorState](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt:8) 
If the data list is obtained, then  display it -- state the [ListShowState](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt:10) 
If the no data list is obtained, we displays an empty list screen -- [ListEmptyState](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentUiStatesModel.kt:9)  


Transition graph


It is somehow not very convenient to keep in ViewModel not only a state, but also the list of states and logic of transition from a state to a state. It would be good to take them separately to avoid duplication and adhere to the principle of single responsibility.

To do this, View must have some kind of contract under which View will display data from ViewModel. accordingly, ViewModel will control the display of data simply by changing the View state. So, add Contract to View.

For this responsible a `Contract` interface declared in [MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract.kt)
Transition graph stored in method named  [render](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract.kt:6) (Especially for frontend backgrounded and for adding Reducer buzzword) in [MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract.kt:6)


`MainFragmentUiStatesModel` also have contracts for ViewModel for showing the states. For example [showInitState](app/src/main/java/ua/zt/mezon/graphomania/fsmandstrategydemo/ui/main/MainFragmentViewStatesRenderContract.kt:26)

### In this implementation, we fulfill the following conditions:

* The state object must be uniquely mapped to the state of the user interface.
* The call chain for the created state should not change over time.
* Adding new states should not affect existing states.
